+ERC-8021: Transaction Attribution
+A standardized method for attributing transactions to applications and wallets through data suffixes, enabling interoperable attribution tracking and reward distribution.
+
+Authors

+
+EIP-5792
+
+Markdown
+
+https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilikesymmetry/ER...
+Abstract
+This ERC defines a standardized method for attributing transactions to applications, wallets, and other entities through structured data suffixes appended to transaction calldata. The standard enables interoperable attribution tracking, supports multiple entity attribution per transaction, and provides a mechanism for reward distribution through registered payout addresses.
+
+Motivation
+Currently, applications informally append "data suffixes" to transactions to indicate their origin, typically using the first bytes of a hash representing the application name. For example, Coinbase adds keccak256("CoinbaseSmartWallet") to transactions from keys.coinbase.com, and apps like Zora and OpenSea employ similar approaches.
+
+This ad-hoc approach presents several limitations:
+
+Non-interoperable attribution: Each application uses custom suffix formats, requiring explicit checks for specific patterns to detect attributions
+Opaque identification: Hash-based suffixes obscure the actual application identity, making attribution analysis difficult
+Reward distribution challenges: Even when an application is identified, there's no standardized way to determine where to send rewards
+Limited multi-entity support: No clear mechanism for attributing transactions to multiple entities (e.g., both application and wallet)
+Lack of extensibility: No standardized way to query additional metadata about attributed entities
+This standard addresses these issues by providing a structured, extensible format for transaction attribution that supports multiple entities, reward distribution, and metadata discovery.
+
+Specification
+The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.
+
+Data Suffix Schema
+This standard defines a structured data suffix format appended to transaction calldata. The suffix consists of the following components (ordered from end of calldata backwards):
+
+ercSuffix (16 bytes): A special identifier value indicating use of this standard ("8021" repeated)
+schemaId (1 byte): Schema ID number that declares the schema of proceeding bytes with space for forwards compatibility
+schemaData (variable bytes): Data to be parsed according to schemaId
+A schemaId MUST have an associated ERC to be considered valid.
+
+Multi-Attribution Schemas
+Our first schemas enable attributing multiple entities in a single transaction.
+
+Entities are identified by a unique "code" which is a string that follows 7-bit ASCII encoding. A code MUST NOT contain commas (0x2C) as this is reserved as a delimitter for attributing multiple codes.
+
+Codes MUST also be registered in a Code Regsitry smart contract (interface defined in later section). Chains are encouraged to provide canonical code registries which MAY be defined in this or future ERCs.
+
+Schema ID 0 defines the following bytes and assumes chain's canonical Code Registry:
+
+codesLength (1 byte): Length of the codes array in bytes, including delimiters
+codes (variable length): Array of attribution codes using ASCII encoding with comma (0x2C) as delimiter
+Schema ID 1 builds on top of 0, but also defines a custom Code Registry chain and address
+
+codesLength (1 byte): Length of the codes array in bytes, including delimiters
+codes (variable length): Array of attribution codes using ASCII encoding with comma (0x2C) as delimiter
+codeRegistryChainIdLength (1 byte): Length of the chain id hosting the custom Code Registry
+codeRegistryChainId (variable bytes): Chain id hosting the custom Code Registry
+codeRegistryAddress (20 bytes): Address of a smart contract implementing ICodeRegistry
+Custom Code Registries can be referenced across chains for ease of connecting identity for multi-chain apps.
+
+Examples
+The complete suffix format is:
+
+{txData}{schemaData}{schemaId}{ercSuffix}
+Single entity attribution with canonical registry:
+
+{txData}{"baseapp"}{7}{0}{0x80218021802180218021802180218021}
+Multiple entity attribution with custom registry:
+
+{txData}{0xCodeRegistry}{8453}{2}{"baseapp,morpho"}{14}{1}{0x80218021802180218021802180218021}
+Parsing Algorithm
+Offchain parsers SHOULD implement the following algorithm:
+
+Extract the last TBD bytes as ercSuffix and verify it matches the standard identifier
+Extract the previous byte as schemaId
+If schemaId is 0: a. Extract the previous byte as codesLength b. Extract the previous codesLength bytes as codes c. Implicitly set codeRegistryAddress as the registry defined by the host chain d. Parse codes using 0x2C (comma) as delimiter between codes e. Query code-related data from codeRegistryAddress on host chain
+If schemaId is 1: a. Extract the previous byte as codesLength b. Extract the previous codesLength bytes as codes c. Extract the previous byte as codeRegistryChainIdLength d. Extract the previous codeRegistryChainIdLength bytes as codeRegistryChainId e. Extract the previous 20 bytes as codeRegistryAddress f. Parse codes using 0x2C (comma) as delimiter between codes g. Query code-related data from codeRegistryAddress on chain with id codeRegistryChainId
+Else schemaId does not match, parsing SHOULD terminate (unknown schemaId)
+Code Registry Interface
+A Code Registry MUST implement the following interface:
+
+interface ICodeRegistry {
+    /// @notice Fetch a code's address to payout incentives
+    /// @param code The code to query
+    /// @return The address to receive rewards for this code
+    function payoutAddress(string memory code) external view returns (address);
+    
+    /// @notice Fetch a code's URI to fetch for additional metadata
+    /// @param code The code to query  
+    /// @return The URI pointing to metadata about this code
+    function codeURI(string memory code) external view returns (string memory);
+    
+    /// @notice Check if a code is valid format (characters, length, etc)
+    /// @dev MUST return false if code is empty string
+    /// @param code The code to query
+    /// @return True if the code is valid, false otherwise
+    function isValidCode(string memory code) external view returns (bool);
+    
+    /// @notice Check if a code is registered
+    /// @param code The code to query
+    /// @return True if the code is registered, false otherwise
+    function isRegistered(string memory code) external view returns (bool);
+}
+Code Regsitry Canonical Addresses
+Chain ID	Code Registry
+8453	TBD
+84532	TBD
+Code Metadata
+Querying CodeRegistry.codeURI(code) returns a string uri to fetch actual metadata, following from NFT patterns. The returned metadata SHOULD include these fields:
+
+type CodeMetadata = {
+    app: {
+      name: string
+      url: string
+    }
+}
+Future ERCs can extend this schema.
+
+ERC-5792 Integration
+Applications using ERC-5792's wallet_sendCalls RPC method MUST communicate attribution data through a new capability:
+
+interface DataSuffixCapability {
+  dataSuffix: string; // Hex-encoded bytes to append as suffix
+}
+Wallets implementing this capability MUST append the provided dataSuffix bytes to the transaction calldata. Wallets MAY optionally insert their own attribution code before the application's suffix if they understand this standard.
+
+ERC-4337 User Operation Implementation
+For ERC-4337 compliant smart accounts, the implementation differs from normal Ethereum transactions:
+
+Normal Transactions: The attribution suffix is appended to the data field of the top-level Ethereum transaction.
+
+ERC-4337 User Operations: The attribution suffix MUST be appended to the userOp.callData field instead of the transaction-level data field, since smart account transactions are executed through the EntryPoint contract where the actual call data is contained within the user operation structure.
+
+When implementing attribution for smart accounts:
+
+Applications SHOULD append the suffix to userOp.callData when constructing user operations
+Parsers MUST examine the callData field of user operations rather than transaction data when processing ERC-4337 transactions
+Wallets supporting both EOA and smart account transactions MUST handle suffix appending appropriately based on the account type
+This ensures attribution data remains accessible and parseable regardless of whether the transaction originates from an externally owned account (EOA) or a smart contract account following ERC-4337.
+
+Rationale
+Design Decisions
+Reverse-order parsing: The suffix format is designed for parsing from the end of calldata backwards, enabling efficient detection of attribution without requiring knowledge of the original calldata length.
+
+schemaId byte: Including a schemaId field enables future extensions and optimizations in minimizing attribution data.
+
+Registry pattern: Using a registry contract allows entities to update their payout addresses and metadata without requiring transaction format changes.
+
+ASCII encoding: Using human-readable ASCII codes improves debuggability and allows for meaningful code names rather than opaque hashes.
+
+ERC-5792 integration: The capability-based approach aligns with ERC-5792's extensible design while providing a clean separation of concerns between applications and wallets.
+
+Alternative Approaches Considered
+Customizable registry: While a single global registry is recommended when available for reduced transaction data, the flexible registry approach allows different ecosystems to maintain their own attribution systems.
+
+Fixed-length codes: A fixed-length encoding was considered but rejected to allow for flexible, human-readable identifiers.
+
+ERC-721 dependency: While codes may be implemented as ERC-721 NFTs, reducing strict dependencies makes this proposal more flexible and clarifies the minimal interface truly required for attribution.
+
+Structured ERC-5792 capability: A generic bytes dataSuffix minimizes the effort on wallets to integrate and maintain support for new schemaIds, increasing chances of wide adoption.
+
+Backwards Compatibility
+This standard is fully backward compatible with existing transaction formats. Transactions without attribution suffixes continue to function normally, and the presence of attribution data does not affect transaction execution.
+
+Existing applications using informal attribution methods can migrate to this standard while maintaining their current functionality during the transition period.
+
+Security Considerations
+Parsing Safety
+Parsers MUST validate the suffix format before processing to prevent malformed data from causing errors. Invalid suffixes SHOULD be ignored rather than causing parsing failures.
+
+Registry Trust
+The security of attribution data depends on the trustworthiness of the registry contract. Users and applications SHOULD verify the registry implementation and governance before relying on its data.
+
+Data Integrity
+Since attribution data is appended to calldata, it could potentially be modified by intermediaries. Applications requiring cryptographic proof of attribution should implement additional signature-based verification mechanisms.
+
+Privacy Considerations
+Attribution data is publicly visible on-chain. Applications handling sensitive user information SHOULD NOT include identifying information in attribution codes.

+Security Advisory: CVE-2025-66478
+Posted by
+Josh Story
+Josh Story
+@joshcstory
+Sebastian Markbåge
+Sebastian Markbåge
+@sebmarkbage
+December 06, 9:05 PM PST: If your application was online and unpatched as of December 4th, 2025 at 1:00 PM PT, we strongly encourage you to rotate any secrets it uses, starting with your most critical ones.
+
+December 06, 7:29 AM PST: An npm package has been released to update affected Next.js apps. Use npx fix-react2shell-next to update now, or visit the GitHub repository to learn more.
+
+A critical vulnerability has been identified in the React Server Components (RSC) protocol. The issue is rated CVSS 10.0 and can allow remote code execution when processing attacker-controlled requests in unpatched environments.
+
+This vulnerability originates in the upstream React implementation (CVE-2025-55182). This advisory (CVE-2025-66478) tracks the downstream impact on Next.js applications using the App Router.
+
+Impact
+The vulnerable RSC protocol allowed untrusted inputs to influence server-side execution behavior. Under specific conditions, an attacker could craft requests that trigger unintended server execution paths. This can result in remote code execution in unpatched environments.
+
+All users should upgrade to a patched version immediately. See the required action section for specific instructions.
+
+Affected Next.js Versions
+Applications using React Server Components with the App Router are affected when running:
+
+Next.js 15.x
+Next.js 16.x
+Next.js 14.3.0-canary.77 and later canary releases
+Next.js 13.x, Next.js 14.x stable, Pages Router applications, and the Edge Runtime are not affected.
+
+Fixed Versions
+The vulnerability is fully resolved in the following patched Next.js releases:
+
+15.0.5
+15.1.9
+15.2.6
+15.3.6
+15.4.8
+15.5.7
+16.0.7
+We also released patched canary releases for Next.js 15 and 16:
+
+15.6.0-canary.58 (for 15.x canary releases)
+16.1.0-canary.12 (for 16.x canary releases)
+These versions include the hardened React Server Components implementation.
+
+Required Action
+All users should upgrade to the latest patched version in their release line:
+
+Terminal
+npm install next@15.0.5   # for 15.0.x
+npm install next@15.1.9   # for 15.1.x
+npm install next@15.2.6   # for 15.2.x
+npm install next@15.3.6   # for 15.3.x
+npm install next@15.4.8   # for 15.4.x
+npm install next@15.5.7   # for 15.5.x
+npm install next@16.0.7   # for 16.0.x
+ 
+npm install next@15.6.0-canary.58   # for 15.x canary releases
+npm install next@16.1.0-canary.12   # for 16.x canary releases
+If you are on Next.js 14.3.0-canary.77 or a later canary release, downgrade to the latest stable 14.x release:
+
+Terminal
+npm install next@14
+If you're currently using canary releases to enable PPR, you can update to 15.6.0-canary.58, which includes a fix for the vulnerability while continuing to support PPR. For other ways to patch older versions, see this discussion post.
+
+Run npx fix-react2shell-next to launch an interactive tool which can check versions and perform deterministic version bumps per the recommended versions above. See the GitHub repository for full details.
+
+Terminal
+npx fix-react2shell-next
+There is no workaround—upgrading to a patched version is required.
+
+Rotating environment variables
+Once you have patched your version and re-deployed your application, we recommend rotating all your application secrets. Learn about working with environment variables in the documentation here.

+## Load Time
+
+* Apps should load within **3 seconds**, and in-app actions should complete within **1 second**.
+* Always show a **loading indicator** when an action is in progress.
+
+## Onboarding Flow
+
+* When a user opens your mini app for the first time, they should see a brief, informative screen explaining what the mini app does and how to get started. Keep this limited to 3 screens, and use succinct language and images.

+
+## User Information & Privacy
+
+* Only ask for personal information when absolutely necessary. Give users context and explain the value of using the app **before** asking for private information.
+* Always explain why the information is needed. Respect user privacy and data minimization principles.
+
+## User Profile
+
+* Show the user’s profile somewhere on the screen, and include their avatar and username used on the Base app
+* **Avoid showing 0x addresses in your mini app.**
+
+## App Description
+
+* Your mini app should have a clear, simple value proposition that makes sense to anyone.
+* Describe what your app does and why it matters in one sentence.
+* **Keep your messaging human, concise, and benefit-focused.**
+
+***Examples**:* “Earn and borrow on your terms”, “Create and share art that lives onchain”
+
+## App Cover Photo
+
+**Do’s ✅**
+
+* Your app’s visuals should make users want to click in and explore.
+* Include a high-quality cover image that feels trustworthy and engaging.
+* Ensure no typos or visual clutter in the image.
+
+**Don’ts ❌**
+
+* Include the Base logo in your cover photo.
+* Include photos of your team

+
+### Display
+
+See how your mini app is displayed in the Base app in our [Figma specification file](https://www.figma.com/design/4wx6s24NB0KLgprQAyMT8R/TBA-Mini-App-Specs).
+
+### Layout
+
+* Keep core actions visible near the top or middle of the screen — not hidden behind scrolls.
+* Limit the number of buttons. Make it obvious what users should do first.
+* Use clear primary calls to action (e.g., “Create”, “Start Game”, “Deposit”).
+* Design for **small viewports** and **portrait orientation.**
+* **Optimize for thumb reach and one-handed use.**
+
+### Navigation
+

+
+* Always include **labels under icons** so users understand each tab.
+
+* Test on multiple device sizes to ensure buttons are not cut off.
+
+### Colors
+
+Use color to communicate clearly, express your brand, and create cohesive mini app experiences.
+
+### **Color Palette**
+
+* **Primary:** Brand color for CTAs and key interactions.
+* **Secondary:** Complements primary; use for accents or secondary actions.
+* **Neutral:** For text, backgrounds, and structure with strong contrast.
+
+### **Themes**
+
+* Support **light and dark modes**:
+* Maintain contrast and brand consistency.
+* Respect system preference but allow manual toggle.
+* Use smooth transitions between themes.
+* **💡Tip:** Use **semantic color tokens** (e.g., `--color-primary`, `--color-background`) with **light/dark theme overrides** for maintainability and flexibility.
+
+### Typography
+
+* Ensure the fonts you use are easy to read. Our team recommends **Inter.**
+* **Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors** to make reading easy under various lighting conditions.
+* **Stick to regular, bold, and italic as needed.** Decorative or script fonts should be reserved for accents, not body text.
+
+### Spacing
+
+* Groups related elements together.
+* Consistent spacing: Creates visual rhythm and predictability with consistent spacing.
+* Give content room to breathe with white space.
+* Avoid cramped layouts.
+* Base Unit: Start with a base spacing unit (typically **4px** or **8px**) and maintain consistency throughout:
+  * 4px base: More granular control, better for mobile.
+  * 8px base: Easier mental math, good for desktop.
+
+### Touch Interactions
+
+* Ensure all touch targets are at least **44px**.
+* Support common gestures (tap, swipe, pinch) where appropriate.
+* Don’t rely on **hover states** — they don’t exist on touch screens.

+
+> Well designed notifications re-engage users, driving retention, and highlight key moments
+
+Notifications will allow you to re-engage users who have saved your Mini App, driving retention and bringing users back at key moments like new content releases, achievements, or time-sensitive events.
+
+Focus on sending updates that are relevant, well-timed, and valuable. It’s important to balance how many notifications you send — too many can cause users to turn them off entirely.
+
+# Anatomy
+
+* Title
+  * Short, clear statement of feature or what’s happening
+  * Max length 32 characters
+* Body
+  * Supporting detail or call-to-action
+  * Max length 128 characters
+* targetURL
+  * URL to open when the user clicks the notification
+  * Max length 1024 characters.Must be on the same domain as the Mini App.
+
+# Best practices
+
+1. **Keep notifications short and clear**\
+   Each notification should be easy to scan. Use the title to state the key details, and keep the body text brief and focused on value. Users should know at a glance what is happening and why it matters.
+
+2. **Control frequency**\
+   Send notifications sparingly. Stay well below the enforced limit (1 every 30 seconds, maximum 100 per day) to avoid users from turning off notifications from your mini app. Focus on moments that truly benefit the user, and avoid sending multiple alerts close together.
+
+3. **Deliver at the right time**\
+   Timing shapes how notifications feel. Send them when they’re most relevant, such as after an event or during active hours. Avoid off-hours or interrupting while users are already in your mini app. Well-timed notifications feel helpful, not disruptive.
+
+4. **Measure and refine**\
+   Analytics reveal whether your notifications are working. High click-through rates show value, rising disabled rates mean you’re overwhelming users. Use these signals to adjust content, timing, or cadence so notifications remain useful.
+
+# Types of notifications
+
+Different mini apps use notifications in different ways. Choose the type that best fits your app’s purpose, and always keep the message relevant.
+
+* **Reminders** encourage users to return regularly
+  * “Your crops are ready to harvest!
+* **Events driven updates** highlight something new or time sensitive.
+  * “BTC is up 5% today! Check your portfolio”
+* **Feature announcements** showcase new functionality or opportunities
+  * Example: “New quest unlocked! More Coins are waiting for you!”
+* **Alerts/warnings** share urgent or critical information
+  * Example: “Your balance is low. Top up to keep trading”
+
+Not every message deserves to be a notification, here are some to avoid:
+
+* **Avoid overly generic nudges**. Messages with no clear value feel spammy, always explain why it matter to the user
+  * Example: “Open the app today!”
+* **Avoid unnecessary confirmations**. Notifications should only confirm meaningful or irreversible events like payments or shipments
+  * Example: “You liked a post”

+
+## Complete Metadata
+
+Metadata includes your manifest and embed metadata. Complete, valid metadata is required for indexing, category placement, and high‑quality embeds.
+
+**Acceptance Criteria**
+
+* Manifest is publicly accessible at `/.well-known/farcaster.json`
+* Required fields are present and valid (`accountAssociation`, `frame`, `primaryCategory`, `tags`)
+* Images meet size/format constraints; text fields respect length limits
+
+**How to Implement**
+
+* Follow the [Manifest guide](/mini-apps/core-concepts/manifest)
+* Implement [embed metadata](/mini-apps/core-concepts/embeds-and-previews#implementation)
+
+<Note>
+  Validate your manifest using our preview tools at <a href="https://base.dev/preview">base.dev/preview</a>.
+</Note>
+
+## In-app Authentication
+
+Users must remain in the Base app throughout the authentication flow. Eliminate flows that bounce users out of the Base app.
+
+**Acceptance Criteria**
+
+* No external redirects
+* No email / phone verification
+* Users can explore before sign‑in when possible
+
+**How to Implement**
+
+* Follow the [Authentication guide](/mini-apps/core-concepts/authentication)
+* Prefer in‑app SIWF/Quick Auth or wallet auth;
+
+## Client-Agnostic
+
+There must be no client‑specific behaviors or wording that degrade the experience in the Base app. You must also ensure that you don't redirect the user to another client for functionality supported in the Base app.
+
+**Acceptance criteria**
+
+* Do not hardcode client‑specific URLs (e.g., Farcaster‑only links)
+* Use neutral language in UI (e.g. use "Share to Feed" instead of "Share to Farcaster")
+* Eliminate buttons that deeplink to other clients for features supported in the Base app
+
+**How to Implement**
+
+* Update all links according to the [Links](/mini-apps/technical-guides/links) guide
+* Review the [Base App Compatability](/mini-apps/troubleshooting/base-app-compatibility) guide for functionality not supported in the Base app. All other functionality must keep users in the Base app.
+
+## Sponsor Transactions
+
+Sponsor transaction fees to remove friction and reduce drop‑off for new users. For mini apps on Base, we recommend using the [Base Paymaster](/onchainkit/paymaster/quickstart-guide).
+
+**Acceptance criteria**
+
+* Transactions are sponsored via a paymaster
+
+**How to Implement**
+
+* Recommended: [Base Paymaster](/onchainkit/paymaster/quickstart-guide)
+
+<Note>
+  Claim free gas credits on <a href="https://base.dev">base.dev</a>.
+</Note>
+
+## Batch Transactions (EIP-5792)
+
+Batch sequential actions where applicable to minimize signatures and reduce friction. Use EIP‑5792 capabilities to send multiple calls in one request.
+
+**Acceptance criteria**
+
+* Where applicable, combine sequential actions into a single batch (e.g. approve + swap)
+
+**How to Implement**
+
+* See [Batch Transactions](/base-account/improve-ux/batch-transactions)
+* Provider APIs: [`wallet_sendCalls`](/base-account/reference/core/provider-rpc-methods/wallet_sendCalls), [`wallet_getCapabilities`](/base-account/reference/core/provider-rpc-methods/wallet_getCapabilities)

+
+> Discover how Mini Apps eliminate  friction and leverage social distribution to create instantly engaging, viral experiences that traditional apps can't match.
+
+The next evolution of digital experiences extends beyond app stores into social feeds and direct messages. Mini Apps are lightweight, social-native apps that launch instantly when you tap them: no downloads, no friction, just immediate engagement. While the Base App provides the discoverability through social distribution and featured listings, Mini Apps deliver the frictionless experience that makes instant trial and viral sharing possible.
+
+<Note>
+  Existing web applications can be converted into Mini Apps. Learn how to [integrate your existing app](/mini-apps/quickstart/existing-apps/install) with our helpful guide.
+</Note>
+
+<Tip>
+  **Framework Compatibility Note**
+  Mini apps built with either the [Farcaster SDK](https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz/) or MiniKit both work seamlessly in the Base app. Choose the framework that best fits your development preferences
+</Tip>
+
+## Beyond the App Store Model
+
+Traditional apps face costly user acquisition because they're buried among millions of competitors in app stores, require separate iOS and Android development with ongoing maintenance across platforms, and create commitment friction through installation requirements. Mini Apps eliminate these barriers entirely by running as lightweight web applications that work instantly across all devices, deploy with zero installation friction, and spread organically through social feeds where users naturally discover content—turning every interaction into potential viral distribution that no app store algorithm can match.
+
+<CardGroup cols={2}>
+  <Card title="Traditional Apps" icon="mobile">

+
+## What Makes Mini Apps Different
+
+### For Users: Frictionless Discovery and Engagement
+
+Mini Apps eliminate the gap between discovery and engagement. Instead of downloading apps you might never use again, you can instantly try interactive experiences shared by friends. With leaderboards, challenges, and multiplayer features, these apps transform from individual experiences into social activities you do with your friends—competing, collaborating, and sharing achievements together.
+
+### For Builders: Built-in Social Infrastructure
+
+As a developer, you build on top of existing social infrastructure instead of recreating it from scratch.
+
+**What you get out of the box:**
+
+* User identity and authentication
+* Social connections and friend graphs
+* Viral distribution mechanisms
+* Immediate access to engaged communities
+
+## The Builder's Advantage
+
+Mini Apps solve three major product development challenges:

+  <Card title="Quick Start Guide" icon="rocket" # Optimize Onboarding
+
+> Reduce friction with wallet‑optional flows and clear value moments
+
+Optimize your onboarding flow to increase user engagement and retention. This guide outlines the best practices that will keep your users in-app and engaged.
+
+### Overview
+
+Deliver value instantly and avoid blocking actions.
+
+* Make the first interaction instant and non-blocking
+* Authenticate only when required for security purposes and defer prompts until necessary
+* Prefer the built-in Base Account; only offer connect/switch for alternate wallets, never gating
+* Use progressive disclosure tied to intent (buy, post, personalize)
+* Keep users in-app with [SDK actions for links](/mini-apps/features/links); avoid fragile static urls
+
+### Recommended onboarding flow
+
+<Steps>
+  <Step title="First render">
+    * Show immediate value (demo content, sample state, or read-only mode)
+    * Personalize instantly with [`context`](/onchainkit/latest/components/minikit/provider-and-initialization) of the user's profile to instantly personalize
+    * Display one clear CTA that leads to a meaningful action (e.g. "Post a message", "Buy a token", "Follow a user")
+  </Step>
+
+  <Step title="User initiates a protected action">
+    * Trigger Sign In with Farcaster (SIWF) / Quick Auth only when needed per [Authentication](/mini-apps/features/Authentication)
+    * For onchain actions, use the Base Account automatically. Eliminate explicit wallet connect flows
+    * Alternate wallets: offer a non-blocking connect/switch option without gating exploration
+  </Step>
+
+  <Step title="Celebrate and amplify">
+    * After success, prompt social actions via [SDK actions](/mini-apps/features/links) and [Sharing & Social Graph](/mini-apps/features/sharing-and-social-graph)
+    * Offer next step: save, follow, or share — optimize with [Search & Discovery](/mini-apps/troubleshooting/how-search-works)
+  </Step>
+</Steps>
+
+### UX patterns that work
+
+<Tip>
+  * Progressive prompts: ask only when needed (buy, post, personalize)
+  * Clear copy: explain why you’re asking ("Sign in to save your score")
+</Tip>
+
+* One-time deep link (Connect Account users): if SIWF requires a one-time Farcaster link to register auth address, message it as a quick, one-time setup and return the user seamlessly
+* Friendly fallbacks: if auth is skipped or fails, allow continued browsing in read-only mode
+
+### Authentication and wallet guidance
+
+#### Authentication
+
+* Only when your backend needs a verified user
+* Use SIWF/Quick Auth to issue a session (JWT) when required
+
+<Warning>
+  Do not treat Mini App context as primary auth (it can be spoofed)
+</Warning>
+
+Read more in [Authentication](/mini-apps/features/Authentication).
+
+#### Wallets
+
+* Base App provides an in-app Base Account. This should be the default wallet used by your app to streamline interactions.
+* Do not show a connect button on first load
+* If you support other wallets, show connect/switch as optional and non-blocking
+* Use the OnchainKit Wallet component or Wagmi hooks as needed
+
+### Do not use raw deeplinks
+
+<Warning>
+  * Always use official SDK actions for cross-client compatibility (e.g., compose cast, view profile)
+  * This prevents dead ends and ensures consistent behavior across hosts
+</Warning>
+
+Learn how to implement them with [SDK actions](/mini-apps/features/links).
+
+### Measure activation and iterate
+
+<Info>
+  * Define activation as the first successful protected action (e.g., first post, first onchain action)
+  * Track funnel: first render → intent click → auth/wallet prompt → success → share/save
+</Info>
+
+* Break down Create Account vs Connect Account behavior to spot friction
+* See: Base Build Analytics (coming soon)
+
+### Implementation checklist
+
+<Check>
+  * Landing screen is usable without auth or wallet prompts
+  * Trigger SIWF/Quick Auth only when backend needs it
+</Check>
+
+* Use MiniKit context for analytics only; avoid using it as primary auth
+* Use Base Account seamlessly for onchain actions; no upfront connect flow
+* If supporting alternate wallets, provide optional, non-blocking connect/switch
+* Use SDK actions for social flows (compose/view) instead of deeplinks
+* Provide a post-success share step and clear next action
+* Test both Create Account and Connect Account paths

+
+**Designing mini apps that people actually come back to.**
+
+Most apps can launch. But few become part of someone's daily rhythm.\
+That's usually not a product problem. It's a people problem.
+
+Social mini apps live or die based on how they make people feel: seen, connected, curious or like they belong. That's not something you tack on — it's something you build in from the start.
+
+If you're designing for feed-based platforms (like Farcaster, Threads, or anything with posts, reactions, and reply chains), this guide will help you:

+
+## How to Use This Guide
+
+Welcome to your blueprint for designing social mini‑apps that people love to revisit. This guide is organized into distinct, actionable sections—each building on the last—to help you move from idea validation to deploying social features with purpose.
+
+<Steps>
+  <Step title="Pressure‑Test Your Idea">
+    Before writing a single line of code or sketching UI, use our four diagnostic questions to see if your concept naturally supports social behavior. Drop your one‑line idea into the supplied prompt to get clear insights on post frequency, social lift, content momentum, and emotional payoff.
+  </Step>
+
+  <Step title="Interpret Feedback & Choose Dimensions">
+    Analyze the responses. Identify which one or two social dimensions resonate
+    most with your concept—whether it's habit formation, community spark, content
+    growth, or emotional reward. The guide shows you how to validate and
+    prioritize those dimensions before moving forward.
+  </Step>
+
+  <Step title="Apply a Case Study Flow">
+    See a worked example that demonstrates how to translate test results into a
+    prototype feature. This mini case study will illustrate rapid iteration,
+    metric considerations, and how to decide when you're ready to scale social
+    elements.
+  </Step>
+
+  <Step title="Explore Three Core Patterns">
+    Dive into the heart of the guide—three social patterns designed to deepen engagement:
+
+    * **Identity Playgrounds:** Customization and self‑expression
+    * **Co‑Creation Loops:** Collaboration and building on each other's posts
+    * **Long‑Term Rituals:** Scheduled, shared activities that foster habit and community
+
+    Each pattern includes explanations, real‑world examples, and copy‑and‑paste prompts to spark your own brainstorming.
+  </Step>
+
+  <Step title="Next Steps & Reflection">
+    Finish with a set of reflective questions and practical advice on measuring success. Use the closing prompts to refine your roadmap, plan experiments, and define key metrics for daily, weekly, and monthly engagement.
+  </Step>
+</Steps>
+
+<Tip>
+  **Tips for Getting the Most Out of This Guide:**
+
+  * **Iterate Quickly:** Treat prompts and patterns as hypotheses. Prototype fast, gather data, and refine.
+  * **Stay Human‑Centered:** At every stage, ask: "How will this make someone feel?"
+  * **Measure What Matters:** Define metrics for each dimension early—then use them to validate your choices.
+  * **Keep It Simple:** You don't need every pattern at once. Start with the one or two dimensions that align strongest with your concept.
+</Tip>
+
+## Pressure-test your idea
+
+Before you get into features or UI, take a step back. Ask whether your idea wants to be social — or if you're forcing it. These prompts are designed to give you structured, clear feedback if you drop them into a LLM or use them in your own reflection.
+
+```
+Here's a one-line description of my app: [insert idea].
+
+Evaluate it across these questions:
+
+1. Why would someone post here more than once?
+2. Would the experience be better with another person involved?
+3. What kind of content might naturally fill the feed over time?
+4. What emotional reward might someone feel when they open it?
+
+Please be direct. If the idea lacks natural social behavior, suggest ways it could evolve.
+```
+
+## Social Patterns
+
+### 1. Identity Playgrounds
+
+**The idea:** Give people ways to explore, express, or shape their identity within the app.
+
+**Why it works:** People don't just use feeds to consume — they use them to perform. Customization invites play, self-expression, and experimentation.
+
+**Where it shows up:** Discord roles, Reddit flair, Tumblr themes.
+
+**Use it for:** Differentiation, emotional investment, repeat posting.
+
+```
+Given my app idea: [insert idea], explore 2 ways users might express or explore identity.
+
+For each, include:
+– What the user customizes or signals
+– How that shows up in the feed
+– Why that might matter over time
+```
+
+### 2. Co-Creation Loops
+
+**The idea:** Design behaviors that are better when shared — where users build on each other's contributions.
+
+**Why it works:** The strongest feeds don't just display content; they build momentum. If one person's post sparks another, you get a chain reaction.
+
+**Where it shows up:** Remix threads, collab playlists, group journaling.
+
+**Use it for:** Participation loops, content momentum, chain reactions.
+
+```
+How could users in [insert app idea] create something together or build on each other's actions?
+Return 3 co-creation flows that include:
+– What kicks it off
+– How others join in
+– What the feed looks like after a few days
+```
+
+### 3. Long-Term Rituals
+
+**The idea:** Introduce regular, shared behaviors that become a rhythm.
+
+**Why it works:** Rituals create predictability, belonging, and anticipation. They give users a reason to come back on a schedule.
+
+**Where it shows up:** Wordle scores, Monday memes, Friday drops, yearly Spotify Wrapped.
+
+**Use it for:** Habit loops, appointment-based engagement, social cohesion.
+
+```
+Design 2 recurring rituals for [insert app idea].
+
+For each, include:
+– Frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)
+– What users post
+– What emotion or payoff they get
+– How it could spread through the feed
+```
+
+## Interpreting your feedback
+
+After you get back raw answers to the four pressure‑test questions, look for the one or two dimensions that most naturally fit your idea. Nail those first, then decide if you need to shore up any others.
+
+<Steps>
+  <Step title="Spot your top dimensions">
+    Scan your AI responses for signs of strength in these four key areas:
+
+    <CardGroup cols={2}>
+      <Card title="Repeat‑posting potential" icon="refresh">
+        **Look for:** "Daily check‑ins create habit" or "Natural reason to post weekly"
+      </Card>
+
+      <Card title="Social lift" icon="users">
+        **Look for:** "Comments spark friendly competition" or "Better with others
+        involved"
+      </Card>
+
+      <Card title="Content momentum" icon="chart-line">
+        **Look for:** "Automated reminders nudge new posts" or "Community‑driven
+        growth"
+      </Card>
+
+      <Card title="Emotional payoff" icon="heart">
+        **Look for:** "Badges tap into achievement" or "Pride in sharing progress"
+      </Card>
+    </CardGroup>
+
+    <Tip>
+      Focus on the dimensions where the AI feedback was most enthusiastic and specific. Vague responses usually indicate weak social potential.
+    </Tip>
+  </Step>
+
+  <Step title="Validate your winners">
+    For each dimension that scored well, confirm the feedback includes clear, actionable examples:
+
+    <AccordionGroup>
+      <Accordion title="Repeat‑posting validation">
+        **Strong signal:** At least 1 post per week feels natural to users
+
+        **Examples to look for:**
+
+        * "Users would naturally share daily progress"
+        * "Weekly challenges create posting rhythm"
+        * "Status updates become habitual"
+
+        **Red flag:** Forced or infrequent posting suggestions
+      </Accordion>
+
+      <Accordion title="Social lift validation">
+        **Strong signal:** Others are meaningfully involved, not just passive viewers
+
+        **Examples to look for:**
+
+        * "Friends can collaborate on projects"
+        * "Comments turn into conversations"
+        * "Peer reactions drive engagement"
+
+        **Red flag:** Social features feel like an afterthought
+      </Accordion>
+
+      <Accordion title="Content momentum validation">
+        **Strong signal:** Community‑driven growth that builds over time
+
+        **Examples to look for:**
+
+        * "Posts inspire similar content from others"
+        * "Popular topics emerge naturally"
+        * "User‑generated content feeds itself"
+
+        **Red flag:** Content relies entirely on individual creators
+      </Accordion>
+
+      <Accordion title="Emotional payoff validation">
+        **Strong signal:** Opening the app delivers a felt reward
+
+        **Examples to look for:**
+
+        * "Users feel proud sharing progress"
+        * "Achievements create satisfaction"
+        * "Community recognition feels meaningful"
+
+        **Red flag:** Emotional benefits are unclear or generic
+      </Accordion>
+    </AccordionGroup>
+  </Step>
+
+  <Step title="Decide your next move">
+    Now that you've identified your strongest dimensions, here's how to proceed:
+
+    <Tabs>
+      <Tab title="Strong Dimensions (2+)">
+        **You're ready to build!**
+
+        If your top 1–2 dimensions check out, skip straight to building social features around them. You don't need to perfect all four dimensions before starting.
+
+        <Check>
+          Focus your energy on the social angles that truly resonate with your concept first.
+        </Check>
+      </Tab>
+
+      <Tab title="Weak Dimensions (0-1)">
+        **Iterate before building**
+
+        If your dimensions are weak, spend time strengthening them before moving to development:
+
+        * **Add a relational hook** (how do others get involved?)
+        * **Include a habit prompt** (what brings people back?)
+        * **Create emotional stakes** (why should users care?)
+
+        <Warning>
+          Don't force social features onto an inherently solo experience. Consider if your idea needs to evolve.
+        </Warning>
+      </Tab>
+    </Tabs>
+
+    **Example Decision Flow:**
+
+    You see strong **"Social lift"** ("Friends' reactions spark threads") and decent **"Emotional payoff"** ("Likes feel rewarding").
+
+    ✅ **Decision:** Prototype a co‑posting feature focusing on these strengths
+
+    ⏳ **Later:** Explore "Content momentum" and "Repeat‑posting" patterns once core social features are solid
+
+    <Info>
+      This focused approach prevents feature bloat and ensures you build social mechanics that actually work for your specific concept.
+    </Info>
+  </Step>
+</Steps>
+
+## Closing note
+
+The mini apps that thrive aren't the most complex — they're the ones that understand how people connect.
+
+<Note>
+  **Remember:**
+
+  * Social features only work when they reflect real human behavior
+  * A feed isn't just content — it's a shared ritual
+  * True engagement comes from meaning over mechanics
+</Note>
+
+As you build, ask: *Why would someone want to come back? Why would they share this with a friend?* Those answers matter more than any feature list.
+
+The best apps don't just fill feeds. They create places people want to return to.\
+So — what will your app make people feel?

+
+* Always include **labels under icons** so users understand each tab.
+
+* Test on multiple device sizes to ensure buttons are not cut off.
+
+### Colors
+
+Use color to communicate clearly, express your brand, and create cohesive mini app experiences.
+
+### **Color Palette**
+
+* **Primary:** Brand color for CTAs and key interactions.
+* **Secondary:** Complements primary; use for accents or secondary actions.
+* **Neutral:** For text, backgrounds, and structure with strong contrast.
+
+### **Themes**
+
+* Support **light and dark modes**:
+* Maintain contrast and brand consistency.
+* Respect system preference but allow manual toggle.
+* Use smooth transitions between themes.
+* **💡Tip:** Use **semantic color tokens** (e.g., `--color-primary`, `--color-background`) with **light/dark theme overrides** for maintainability and flexibility.
+
+### Typography
+
+* Ensure the fonts you use are easy to read. Our team recommends **Inter.**
+* **Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors** to make reading easy under various lighting conditions.
+* **Stick to regular, bold, and italic as needed.** Decorative or script fonts should be reserved for accents, not body text.
+
+### Spacing
+
+* Groups related elements together.
+* Consistent spacing: Creates visual rhythm and predictability with consistent spacing.
+* Give content room to breathe with white space.
+* Avoid cramped layouts.
+* Base Unit: Start with a base spacing unit (typically **4px** or **8px**) and maintain consistency throughout:
+  * 4px base: More granular control, better for mobile.
+  * 8px base: Easier mental math, good for desktop.
+
+### Touch Interactions
+
+* Ensure all touch targets are at least **44px**.
+* Support common gestures (tap, swipe, pinch) where appropriate.
+* Don’t rely on **hover states** — they don’t exist on touch screens.

+
+> Well designed notifications re-engage users, driving retention, and highlight key moments
+
+Notifications will allow you to re-engage users who have saved your Mini App, driving retention and bringing users back at key moments like new content releases, achievements, or time-sensitive events.
+
+Focus on sending updates that are relevant, well-timed, and valuable. It’s important to balance how many notifications you send — too many can cause users to turn them off entirely.
+
+# Anatomy
+
+* Title
+  * Short, clear statement of feature or what’s happening
+  * Max length 32 characters
+* Body
+  * Supporting detail or call-to-action
+  * Max length 128 characters
+* targetURL
+  * URL to open when the user clicks the notification
+  * Max length 1024 characters.Must be on the same domain as the Mini App.
+
+# Best practices
+
+1. **Keep notifications short and clear**\
+   Each notification should be easy to scan. Use the title to state the key details, and keep the body text brief and focused on value. Users should know at a glance what is happening and why it matters.
+
+2. **Control frequency**\
+   Send notifications sparingly. Stay well below the enforced limit (1 every 30 seconds, maximum 100 per day) to avoid users from turning off notifications from your mini app. Focus on moments that truly benefit the user, and avoid sending multiple alerts close together.
+
+3. **Deliver at the right time**\
+   Timing shapes how notifications feel. Send them when they’re most relevant, such as after an event or during active hours. Avoid off-hours or interrupting while users are already in your mini app. Well-timed notifications feel helpful, not disruptive.
+
+4. **Measure and refine**\
+   Analytics reveal whether your notifications are working. High click-through rates show value, rising disabled rates mean you’re overwhelming users. Use these signals to adjust content, timing, or cadence so notifications remain useful.
+
+# Types of notifications
+
+Different mini apps use notifications in different ways. Choose the type that best fits your app’s purpose, and always keep the message relevant.
+
+* **Reminders** encourage users to return regularly
+  * “Your crops are ready to harvest!
+* **Events driven updates** highlight something new or time sensitive.
+  * “BTC is up 5% today! Check your portfolio”
+* **Feature announcements** showcase new functionality or opportunities
+  * Example: “New quest unlocked! More Coins are waiting for you!”
+* **Alerts/warnings** share urgent or critical information
+  * Example: “Your balance is low. Top up to keep trading”
+
+Not every message deserves to be a notification, here are some to avoid:
+
+* **Avoid overly generic nudges**. Messages with no clear value feel spammy, always explain why it matter to the user
+  * Example: “Open the app today!”
+* **Avoid unnecessary confirmations**. Notifications should only confirm meaningful or irreversible events like payments or shipments
+  * Example: “You liked a post”
+

+> Ensure your mini app is built for the Base app
+
+## Complete Metadata
+
+Metadata includes your manifest and embed metadata. Complete, valid metadata is required for indexing, category placement, and high‑quality embeds.
+
+**Acceptance Criteria**
+
+* Manifest is publicly accessible at `/.well-known/farcaster.json`
+* Required fields are present and valid (`accountAssociation`, `frame`, `primaryCategory`, `tags`)
+* Images meet size/format constraints; text fields respect length limits
+
+**How to Implement**
+
+* Follow the [Manifest guide](/mini-apps/core-concepts/manifest)
+* Implement [embed metadata](/mini-apps/core-concepts/embeds-and-previews#implementation)
+
+<Note>
+  Validate your manifest using our preview tools at <a href="https://base.dev/preview">base.dev/preview</a>.
+</Note>
+
+## In-app Authentication
+
+Users must remain in the Base app throughout the authentication flow. Eliminate flows that bounce users out of the Base app.
+
+**Acceptance Criteria**
+
+* No external redirects
+* No email / phone verification
+* Users can explore before sign‑in when possible
+
+**How to Implement**
+
+* Follow the [Authentication guide](/mini-apps/core-concepts/authentication)
+* Prefer in‑app SIWF/Quick Auth or wallet auth;
+
+## Client-Agnostic
+
+There must be no client‑specific behaviors or wording that degrade the experience in the Base app. You must also ensure that you don't redirect the user to another client for functionality supported in the Base app.
+
+**Acceptance criteria**
+
+* Do not hardcode client‑specific URLs (e.g., Farcaster‑only links)
+* Use neutral language in UI (e.g. use "Share to Feed" instead of "Share to Farcaster")
+* Eliminate buttons that deeplink to other clients for features supported in the Base app
+
+**How to Implement**
+
+* Update all links according to the [Links](/mini-apps/technical-guides/links) guide
+* Review the [Base App Compatability](/mini-apps/troubleshooting/base-app-compatibility) guide for functionality not supported in the Base app. All other functionality must keep users in the Base app.
+
+## Sponsor Transactions
+
+Sponsor transaction fees to remove friction and reduce drop‑off for new users. For mini apps on Base, we recommend using the [Base Paymaster](/onchainkit/paymaster/quickstart-guide).
+
+**Acceptance criteria**
+
+* Transactions are sponsored via a paymaster
+
+**How to Implement**
+
+* Recommended: [Base Paymaster](/onchainkit/paymaster/quickstart-guide)
+
+<Note>
+  Claim free gas credits on <a href="https://base.dev">base.dev</a>.
+</Note>
+
+## Batch Transactions (EIP-5792)
+
+Batch sequential actions where applicable to minimize signatures and reduce friction. Use EIP‑5792 capabilities to send multiple calls in one request.
+
+**Acceptance criteria**
+
+* Where applicable, combine sequential actions into a single batch (e.g. approve + swap)
+
+**How to Implement**
+
+* See [Batch Transactions](/base-account/improve-ux/batch-transactions)
+* Provider APIs: [`wallet_sendCalls`](/base-account/reference/core/provider-rpc-methods/wallet_sendCalls), [`wallet_getCapabilities`](/base-account/reference/core/provider-rpc-methods/wallet_getCapabilities)

+
+> Discover how Mini Apps eliminate  friction and leverage social distribution to create instantly engaging, viral experiences that traditional apps can't match.
+
+The next evolution of digital experiences extends beyond app stores into social feeds and direct messages. Mini Apps are lightweight, social-native apps that launch instantly when you tap them: no downloads, no friction, just immediate engagement. While the Base App provides the discoverability through social distribution and featured listings, Mini Apps deliver the frictionless experience that makes instant trial and viral sharing possible.
+
+<Note>
+  Existing web applications can be converted into Mini Apps. Learn how to [integrate your existing app](/mini-apps/quickstart/existing-apps/install) with our helpful guide.
+</Note>
+
+<Tip>
+  **Framework Compatibility Note**
+  Mini apps built with either the [Farcaster SDK](https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz/) or MiniKit both work seamlessly in the Base app. Choose the framework that best fits your development preferences
+</Tip>
+
+## Beyond the App Store Model
+
+Traditional apps face costly user acquisition because they're buried among millions of competitors in app stores, require separate iOS and Android development with ongoing maintenance across platforms, and create commitment friction through installation requirements. Mini Apps eliminate these barriers entirely by running as lightweight web applications that work instantly across all devices, deploy with zero installation friction, and spread organically through social feeds where users naturally discover content—turning every interaction into potential viral distribution that no app store algorithm can match.
+
+<CardGroup cols={2}>
+  <Card title="Traditional Apps" icon="mobile">
+    * Limited to app store discovery
+    * Require downloads and installations
+    * Expensive user acquisition campaigns
+    * Users start with empty social graphs
+  </Card>
+
+  <Card title="Mini Apps" icon="rocket">
+    * Distributed through social feeds
+    * Launch instantly with one tap
+    * Viral distribution through social sharing
+    * Built-in friend networks and social context
+  </Card>
+</CardGroup>
+
+## What Makes Mini Apps Different
+
+### For Users: Frictionless Discovery and Engagement
+
+Mini Apps eliminate the gap between discovery and engagement. Instead of downloading apps you might never use again, you can instantly try interactive experiences shared by friends. With leaderboards, challenges, and multiplayer features, these apps transform from individual experiences into social activities you do with your friends—competing, collaborating, and sharing achievements together.
+
+### For Builders: Built-in Social Infrastructure
+
+As a developer, you build on top of existing social infrastructure instead of recreating it from scratch.
+
+**What you get out of the box:**
+
+* User identity and authentication
+* Social connections and friend graphs
+* Viral distribution mechanisms
+* Immediate access to engaged communities
+
+## The Builder's Advantage
+
+Mini Apps solve three major product development challenges:

+  <Card title="Quick Start Guide" icon="rocket" # Optimize Onboarding
+
+> Reduce friction with wallet‑optional flows and clear value moments
+
+Optimize your onboarding flow to increase user engagement and retention. This guide outlines the best practices that will keep your users in-app and engaged.
+
+### Overview
+
+Deliver value instantly and avoid blocking actions.
+
+* Make the first interaction instant and non-blocking
+* Authenticate only when required for security purposes and defer prompts until necessary
+* Prefer the built-in Base Account; only offer connect/switch for alternate wallets, never gating
+* Use progressive disclosure tied to intent (buy, post, personalize)
+* Keep users in-app with [SDK actions for links](/mini-apps/features/links); avoid fragile static urls
+
+### Recommended onboarding flow
+
+<Steps>
+  <Step title="First render">
+    * Show immediate value (demo content, sample state, or read-only mode)
+    * Personalize instantly with [`context`](/onchainkit/latest/components/minikit/provider-and-initialization) of the user's profile to instantly personalize
+    * Display one clear CTA that leads to a meaningful action (e.g. "Post a message", "Buy a token", "Follow a user")
+  </Step>
+
+  <Step title="User initiates a protected action">
+    * Trigger Sign In with Farcaster (SIWF) / Quick Auth only when needed per [Authentication](/mini-apps/features/Authentication)
+    * For onchain actions, use the Base Account automatically. Eliminate explicit wallet connect flows
+    * Alternate wallets: offer a non-blocking connect/switch option without gating exploration
+  </Step>
+
+  <Step title="Celebrate and amplify">
+    * After success, prompt social actions via [SDK actions](/mini-apps/features/links) and [Sharing & Social Graph](/mini-apps/features/sharing-and-social-graph)
+    * Offer next step: save, follow, or share — optimize with [Search & Discovery](/mini-apps/troubleshooting/how-search-works)
+  </Step>
+</Steps>
+
+### UX patterns that work
+
+<Tip>
+  * Progressive prompts: ask only when needed (buy, post, personalize)
+  * Clear copy: explain why you’re asking ("Sign in to save your score")
+</Tip>
+
+* One-time deep link (Connect Account users): if SIWF requires a one-time Farcaster link to register auth address, message it as a quick, one-time setup and return the user seamlessly
+* Friendly fallbacks: if auth is skipped or fails, allow continued browsing in read-only mode
+
+### Authentication and wallet guidance
+
+#### Authentication
+
+* Only when your backend needs a verified user
+* Use SIWF/Quick Auth to issue a session (JWT) when required
+
+<Warning>
+  Do not treat Mini App context as primary auth (it can be spoofed)
+</Warning>
+
+Read more in [Authentication](/mini-apps/features/Authentication).
+
+#### Wallets
+
+* Base App provides an in-app Base Account. This should be the default wallet used by your app to streamline interactions.
+* Do not show a connect button on first load
+* If you support other wallets, show connect/switch as optional and non-blocking
+* Use the OnchainKit Wallet component or Wagmi hooks as needed
+
+### Do not use raw deeplinks
+
+<Warning>
+  * Always use official SDK actions for cross-client compatibility (e.g., compose cast, view profile)
+  * This prevents dead ends and ensures consistent behavior across hosts
+</Warning>
+
+Learn how to implement them with [SDK actions](/mini-apps/features/links).
+
+### Measure activation and iterate
+
+<Info>
+  * Define activation as the first successful protected action (e.g., first post, first onchain action)
+  * Track funnel: first render → intent click → auth/wallet prompt → success → share/save
+</Info>
+
+* Break down Create Account vs Connect Account behavior to spot friction
+* See: Base Build Analytics (coming soon)
+
+### Implementation checklist
+
+<Check>
+  * Landing screen is usable without auth or wallet prompts
+  * Trigger SIWF/Quick Auth only when backend needs it
+</Check>
+
+* Use MiniKit context for analytics only; avoid using it as primary auth
+* Use Base Account seamlessly for onchain actions; no upfront connect flow
+* If supporting alternate wallets, provide optional, non-blocking connect/switch
+* Use SDK actions for social flows (compose/view) instead of deeplinks
+* Provide a post-success share step and clear next action
+* Test both Create Account and Connect Account paths

+
+**Designing mini apps that people actually come back to.**
+
+Most apps can launch. But few become part of someone's daily rhythm.\
+That's usually not a product problem. It's a people problem.
+
+Social mini apps live or die based on how they make people feel: seen, connected, curious or like they belong. That's not something you tack on — it's something you build in from the start.
+
+If you're designing for feed-based platforms (like Farcaster, Threads, or anything with posts, reactions, and reply chains), this guide will help you:

+
+## How to Use This Guide
+
+Welcome to your blueprint for designing social mini‑apps that people love to revisit. This guide is organized into distinct, actionable sections—each building on the last—to help you move from idea validation to deploying social features with purpose.
+
+<Steps>
+  <Step title="Pressure‑Test Your Idea">
+    Before writing a single line of code or sketching UI, use our four diagnostic questions to see if your concept naturally supports social behavior. Drop your one‑line idea into the supplied prompt to get clear insights on post frequency, social lift, content momentum, and emotional payoff.
+  </Step>
+
+  <Step title="Interpret Feedback & Choose Dimensions">
+    Analyze the responses. Identify which one or two social dimensions resonate
+    most with your concept—whether it's habit formation, community spark, content
+    growth, or emotional reward. The guide shows you how to validate and
+    prioritize those dimensions before moving forward.
+  </Step>
+
+  <Step title="Apply a Case Study Flow">
+    See a worked example that demonstrates how to translate test results into a
+    prototype feature. This mini case study will illustrate rapid iteration,
+    metric considerations, and how to decide when you're ready to scale social
+    elements.
+  </Step>
+
+  <Step title="Explore Three Core Patterns">
+    Dive into the heart of the guide—three social patterns designed to deepen engagement:
+
+    * **Identity Playgrounds:** Customization and self‑expression
+    * **Co‑Creation Loops:** Collaboration and building on each other's posts
+    * **Long‑Term Rituals:** Scheduled, shared activities that foster habit and community
+
+    Each pattern includes explanations, real‑world examples, and copy‑and‑paste prompts to spark your own brainstorming.
+  </Step>
+
+  <Step title="Next Steps & Reflection">
+    Finish with a set of reflective questions and practical advice on measuring success. Use the closing prompts to refine your roadmap, plan experiments, and define key metrics for daily, weekly, and monthly engagement.
+  </Step>
+</Steps>
+
+<Tip>
+  **Tips for Getting the Most Out of This Guide:**
+
+  * **Iterate Quickly:** Treat prompts and patterns as hypotheses. Prototype fast, gather data, and refine.
+  * **Stay Human‑Centered:** At every stage, ask: "How will this make someone feel?"
+  * **Measure What Matters:** Define metrics for each dimension early—then use them to validate your choices.
+  * **Keep It Simple:** You don't need every pattern at once. Start with the one or two dimensions that align strongest with your concept.
+</Tip>
+
+## Pressure-test your idea
+
+Before you get into features or UI, take a step back. Ask whether your idea wants to be social — or if you're forcing it. These prompts are designed to give you structured, clear feedback if you drop them into a LLM or use them in your own reflection.
+
+```
+Here's a one-line description of my app: [insert idea].
+
+Evaluate it across these questions:
+
+1. Why would someone post here more than once?
+2. Would the experience be better with another person involved?
+3. What kind of content might naturally fill the feed over time?
+4. What emotional reward might someone feel when they open it?
+
+Please be direct. If the idea lacks natural social behavior, suggest ways it could evolve.
+```
+
+## Social Patterns
+
+### 1. Identity Playgrounds
+
+**The idea:** Give people ways to explore, express, or shape their identity within the app.
+
+**Why it works:** People don't just use feeds to consume — they use them to perform. Customization invites play, self-expression, and experimentation.
+
+**Where it shows up:** Discord roles, Reddit flair, Tumblr themes.
+
+**Use it for:** Differentiation, emotional investment, repeat posting.
+
+```
+Given my app idea: [insert idea], explore 2 ways users might express or explore identity.
+
+For each, include:
+– What the user customizes or signals
+– How that shows up in the feed
+– Why that might matter over time
+```
+
+### 2. Co-Creation Loops
+
+**The idea:** Design behaviors that are better when shared — where users build on each other's contributions.
+
+**Why it works:** The strongest feeds don't just display content; they build momentum. If one person's post sparks another, you get a chain reaction.
+
+**Where it shows up:** Remix threads, collab playlists, group journaling.
+
+**Use it for:** Participation loops, content momentum, chain reactions.
+
+```
+How could users in [insert app idea] create something together or build on each other's actions?
+Return 3 co-creation flows that include:
+– What kicks it off
+– How others join in
+– What the feed looks like after a few days
+```
+
+### 3. Long-Term Rituals
+
+**The idea:** Introduce regular, shared behaviors that become a rhythm.
+
+**Why it works:** Rituals create predictability, belonging, and anticipation. They give users a reason to come back on a schedule.
+
+**Where it shows up:** Wordle scores, Monday memes, Friday drops, yearly Spotify Wrapped.
+
+**Use it for:** Habit loops, appointment-based engagement, social cohesion.
+
+```
+Design 2 recurring rituals for [insert app idea].
+
+For each, include:
+– Frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)
+– What users post
+– What emotion or payoff they get
+– How it could spread through the feed
+```
+
+## Interpreting your feedback
+
+After you get back raw answers to the four pressure‑test questions, look for the one or two dimensions that most naturally fit your idea. Nail those first, then decide if you need to shore up any others.
+
+<Steps>
+  <Step title="Spot your top dimensions">
+    Scan your AI responses for signs of strength in these four key areas:

+    </CardGroup>
+
+    <Tip>
+      Focus on the dimensions where the AI feedback was most enthusiastic and specific. Vague responses usually indicate weak social potential.
+    </Tip>
+  </Step>
+
+  <Step title="Validate your winners">
+    For each dimension that scored well, confirm the feedback includes clear, actionable examples:
+
+    <AccordionGroup>
+      <Accordion title="Repeat‑posting validation">
+        **Strong signal:** At least 1 post per week feels natural to users
+
+        **Examples to look for:**
+
+        * "Users would naturally share daily progress"
+        * "Weekly challenges create posting rhythm"
+        * "Status updates become habitual"
+
+        **Red flag:** Forced or infrequent posting suggestions
+      </Accordion>
+
+      <Accordion title="Social lift validation">
+        **Strong signal:** Others are meaningfully involved, not just passive viewers
+
+        **Examples to look for:**
+
+        * "Friends can collaborate on projects"
+        * "Comments turn into conversations"
+        * "Peer reactions drive engagement"
+
+        **Red flag:** Social features feel like an afterthought
+      </Accordion>
+
+      <Accordion title="Content momentum validation">
+        **Strong signal:** Community‑driven growth that builds over time
+
+        **Examples to look for:**
+
+        * "Posts inspire similar content from others"
+        * "Popular topics emerge naturally"
+        * "User‑generated content feeds itself"
+
+        **Red flag:** Content relies entirely on individual creators
+      </Accordion>
+
+      <Accordion title="Emotional payoff validation">
+        **Strong signal:** Opening the app delivers a felt reward
+
+        **Examples to look for:**
+
+        * "Users feel proud sharing progress"
+        * "Achievements create satisfaction"
+        * "Community recognition feels meaningful"
+
+        **Red flag:** Emotional benefits are unclear or generic
+      </Accordion>
+    </AccordionGroup>
+  </Step>
+
+  <Step title="Decide your next move">
+    Now that you've identified your strongest dimensions, here's how to proceed:
+
+    <Tabs>
+      <Tab title="Strong Dimensions (2+)">
+        **You're ready to build!**
+
+        If your top 1–2 dimensions check out, skip straight to building social features around them. You don't need to perfect all four dimensions before starting.
+
+        <Check>
+          Focus your energy on the social angles that truly resonate with your concept first.
+        </Check>
+      </Tab>
+
+      <Tab title="Weak Dimensions (0-1)">
+        **Iterate before building**
+
+        If your dimensions are weak, spend time strengthening them before moving to development:
+
+        * **Add a relational hook** (how do others get involved?)
+        * **Include a habit prompt** (what brings people back?)
+        * **Create emotional stakes** (why should users care?)
+
+        <Warning>
+          Don't force social features onto an inherently solo experience. Consider if your idea needs to evolve.
+        </Warning>
+      </Tab>
+    </Tabs>
+
+    **Example Decision Flow:**
+
+    You see strong **"Social lift"** ("Friends' reactions spark threads") and decent **"Emotional payoff"** ("Likes feel rewarding").
+
+    ✅ **Decision:** Prototype a co‑posting feature focusing on these strengths
+
+    ⏳ **Later:** Explore "Content momentum" and "Repeat‑posting" patterns once core social features are solid
+
+    <Info>
+      This focused approach prevents feature bloat and ensures you build social mechanics that actually work for your specific concept.
+    </Info>
+  </Step>
+</Steps>
+
+## Closing note
+
+The mini apps that thrive aren't the most complex — they're the ones that understand how people connect.
+
+<Note>
+  **Remember:**
+
+  * Social features only work when they reflect real human behavior
+  * A feed isn't just content — it's a shared ritual
+  * True engagement comes from meaning over mechanics
+</Note>
+
+As you build, ask: *Why would someone want to come back? Why would they share this with a friend?* Those answers matter more than any feature list.
+
+The best apps don't just fill feeds. They create places people want to return to.\
+So — what will your app make people feel?
